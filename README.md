## About The Project
The Western Green Bin Project is a comprehensive initiative aimed at promoting environmentally sustainable waste management practices within the residential facilities of Western University. We aim to provide students with a convenient and accessible system to separate and dispose of organic waste responsibly. By implementing green bins in each dormitory and integrating a dedicated mobile app, we aim to foster a culture of responsible waste management and contribute to a greener future.
